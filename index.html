        <h3>Emerging Web Developer</h3> 
        <p>Hi there! I am Syed Ashraf Asif and currently I am studying in CSE department of Comilla University. After the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, I thought of joining in a web development course. It was utterly mundane to waste time on nothing. That pushed me to do something productive and skillful like web developping. Fortunately, I managed to enroll in Bangla Programmimg Hero's complete web development course which has famous public figure <b>Jhankar Mahbub</b>  as the instructor!
